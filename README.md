#php database interaction

i wanted to create a webpage where the user can register himself into the systems database.
Be able to login into the system database 

All this so as to be able to update and delete the records in the database.
Also added some bit of sytling for better outlook and javascript for better user experience.

It also has the php info of the local databasei was using in my local host.
